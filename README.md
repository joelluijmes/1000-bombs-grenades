# 1000 Bombs & Grenades!

> [!WARNING]
> I just started out building this game. I just put it on GitHub as means of version control.

## Project Overview

This is a digital adaptation of the physical board game "1000 Bommen & Granaten" created by Haim Shafir and published by 999 Games. The purpose of this project is twofold: to serve as a learning exercise for the Dart programming language and to create a platform for implementing and testing various AI algorithms, particularly Q-learning and other reinforcement learning approaches. The ultimate goal is to develop AI agents that can learn optimal strategies for this dice-based decision game.

## Game Overview

For extensive details on the game's rules, components, and mechanics, please refer to the [official game manual](https://www.999games.nl/1000-bommen-granaten.html). I created an English version at [game_overview.md](docs/game_overview.md). I hope it is complete, at least it indicates the symbols I use in the game ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.
